# Tournament Overview

## What Are Tournaments?

Tournaments are competitive training events where miners submit their open-source training repositories and validators execute them on standardized infrastructure. The system runs continuous cycles managed by three main processes:

- `process_pending_tournaments()` - Populates participants and activates tournaments
- `process_pending_rounds()` - Creates tasks and assigns nodes 
- `process_active_tournaments()` - Advances tournaments through completion

Unlike real-time serving where miners train models on their own hardware for [Gradients.io](https://gradients.io) customers, tournaments focus purely on the quality of training methodologies.

## Why Tournaments Matter

- **üîç Transparency**: Enterprise customers can see exactly how models are trained
- **‚ö° Innovation**: Cutting-edge techniques are implemented within hours of publication  
- **üèÜ Competition**: Only the best AutoML approaches survive the tournament structure
- **üìñ Open Source**: Winning methodologies become available to the entire AI community

## Tournament Schedule & Timing

Based on `TOURNAMENT_INTERVAL_HOURS = 24`, the system automatically schedules tournaments:

- **Duration**: 4-7 days per tournament
- **Gap Between Tournaments**: 24 hours after completion before next tournament starts
- **Tournament Types**: Text and Image tournaments run independently via `TournamentType.TEXT` and `TournamentType.IMAGE`
- **Auto-Creation**: `process_tournament_scheduling()` creates new tournaments when previous ones complete

## Tournament Lifecycle

### 1. Tournament Creation (`TournamentStatus.PENDING`)
- System creates basic tournament with `generate_tournament_id()`
- Adds base contestant (defending champion) if available
- Begins participant registration process

### 2. Participant Registration
- Miners must have minimum stake requirements (boosted by previous completions)
- System pings miners via `/training_repo/{task_type}` endpoint
- Top participants selected by `TOURNAMENT_TOP_N_BY_STAKE = 32`
- Requires minimum `MIN_MINERS_FOR_TOURN = 8` to proceed

### 3. Tournament Activation (`TournamentStatus.ACTIVE`)
- First round created with `_create_first_round()`
- Round structure determined by participant count:
  - **Group Stage**: 16+ miners ‚Üí groups of 6-8 (`EXPECTED_GROUP_SIZE = 8`)
  - **Knockout Stage**: <16 miners ‚Üí head-to-head pairs

### 4. Task Creation & Assignment

#### Group Stage Tasks
- **Text tournaments**: 1 Instruct + 1 DPO + 1 GRPO task per group
- **Image tournaments**: `IMAGE_TASKS_PER_GROUP = 3` tasks per group

#### Knockout Stage Tasks  
- **Text tournaments**: 1 probabilistically selected task per pair (Instruct/DPO/GRPO)
- **Image tournaments**: 1 task per pair (SDXL or Flux)

#### Final Round Tasks
- **Text tournaments**: 1 of each type (Instruct + DPO + GRPO) with big models
- **Image tournaments**: 3 image tasks all assigned to same pair

Tasks assigned to trainer nodes via `assign_nodes_to_tournament_tasks()` with expected repo names: `tournament-{tournament_id}-{task_id}-{hotkey[:8]}`

## Tournament Compute Allocation

### GPU Requirements by Model Size

Dynamic allocation based on `get_tournament_gpu_requirement()`:

**Text Tasks:**
```python
params_b = model_params_count / 1_000_000_000

# Task type multipliers
if task_type == TaskType.DPOTASK:
    params_b *= TOURNAMENT_DPO_GPU_MULTIPLIER  # 3x
elif task_type == TaskType.GRPOTASK:
    params_b *= TOURNAMENT_GRPO_GPU_MULTIPLIER  # 2x

# GPU allocation thresholds
if params_b <= TOURNAMENT_GPU_THRESHOLD_FOR_2X_H100:  # 4.0B
    return GpuRequirement.H100_1X
elif params_b <= TOURNAMENT_GPU_THRESHOLD_FOR_4X_H100:  # 12.0B
    return GpuRequirement.H100_2X  
elif params_b <= TOURNAMENT_GPU_THRESHOLD_FOR_8X_H100:  # 40.0B
    return GpuRequirement.H100_4X
else:
    return GpuRequirement.H100_8X
```

**Image Tasks:**
- All image tasks (SDXL, Flux) receive `GpuRequirement.A100`

### Trainer Node Execution
- Tournament orchestrator finds suitable GPUs via `_check_suitable_gpus()`
- Training executed using miner's Docker containers and scripts
- Memory limit: `DEFAULT_TRAINING_CONTAINER_MEM_LIMIT = "24g"`
- CPU limit: `DEFAULT_TRAINING_CONTAINER_NANO_CPUS = 8`
- Network isolation: `--network none` for security

## Round Management

### Round Status Flow
```
PENDING ‚Üí ACTIVE ‚Üí COMPLETED
```

### Task Execution Monitoring
- Progress tracked through `monitor_training_tasks()`
- Training status: `PENDING ‚Üí TRAINING ‚Üí SUCCESS/FAILURE`
- GPU availability updated when tasks complete
- Failed tasks moved back to `PENDING` for retry (up to `MAX_TRAINING_ATTEMPTS = 2`)

### Round Completion & Advancement
- System waits for all tasks to reach `TaskStatus.SUCCESS` or `TaskStatus.FAILURE`
- Winners calculated using tournament scoring system
- Losers eliminated, stake requirements checked for winners
- Next round created with winners, or tournament completes

## Boss Round Mechanics

When tournament reaches final round with single winner:

1. **Boss Round Sync**: `sync_boss_round_tasks_to_general()` copies tasks to main evaluation cycle (real-time miners)
2. **Delay Strategy**: Tasks scheduled with random 1-4 hour delays to prevent gaming
3. **Winner Determination**: Based on `calculate_final_round_winner()` with 5% margin requirement
4. **Champion Defense**: Previous winner retains title unless clearly outperformed

## Scoring & Weight Distribution

Tournament results feed into exponential weight decay system:
- Round winners get `round_number * type_weight` points
- Type weights defined by `TOURNAMENT_TEXT_WEIGHT` and `TOURNAMENT_IMAGE_WEIGHT` constants
- Final weights calculated using `exponential_decline_mapping()` with `TOURNAMENT_WEIGHT_DECAY_RATE`
- Previous winners get special placement based on boss round performance

## Technical Integration Points

### For Miners
- Implement `/training_repo/{task_type}` endpoint
- Ensure training scripts accept standardized CLI arguments
- Include WandB logging for validator monitoring (`wandb_mode = "offline"`)
- Output models to exact paths: `/app/checkpoints/{task_id}/{expected_repo_name}`
- Handle all task types within your tournament category
